AgentSeekBehaviour taken from Hamids EnemySeek.cs

Dodge Behaviour should be move and shoot tactics
possibly with bounding movement? At the very least
this should have BANGBANG-MOVE-BANGBANG function
"fire without movement is a waste of ammo, but movement without fire is suicide"

NOTE possibly meaningful
hamids incr/decr is PROCEEDED
with the operator (ie ++i rather than i++)
does this make a difference??
	i = 1    ++i     i increments to 2 then returns 2
	i = 1    i++     i returns 1 then increments to 2    must save a temporary variable to carry this out!!!


Questions:
	How do I take the found path and make the agents seek to each node?
		Pop each node off of the list and set its (x,y) to targetPosition

	How do I create Nodes on each grid square, without writing over content within
	the DO NOT CHANGE directory to use pathfinding algorithms such as A*?

	How do I create a WTS system if the content I (think) need to
	modify is locked behind DO NOT CHANGE?

AgentSeekBehaviour taken from Hamids EnemySeek.cs

Dodge Behaviour should be move and shoot tactics
possibly with bounding movement? At the very least
this should have BANGBANG-MOVE-BANGBANG function
"fire without movement is a waste of ammo, but movement without fire is suicide"

NOTE possibly meaningful
hamids incr/decr is PROCEEDED
with the operator (ie ++i rather than i++)
does this make a difference??

i = 1    ++i     i increments to 2 then returns 2
i = 1    i++     i returns 1 then increments to 2    must save a temporary variable to carry this out!!!
